# IPL-Record-Keeping
This application can be used for record keeping through an IPL tournament.
First this was done without a GUI in c++, then I did it in Java in the subsequent semester using swing.
The c++ version had some additional features that were not implemented in the java version, like the simulation of run outs and the prediction of the who is going to be at strike on the next ball... and some more too. Both versions are incomplete but I hope they are good enough to be included in a resume for your company.
